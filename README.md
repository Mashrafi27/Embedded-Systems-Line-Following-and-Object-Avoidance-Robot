# Embedded-Systems-Line-Following-and-Object-Avoidance-Robot

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to design and implement an autonomous robot capable of following lines and detecting objects to adjust its path accordingly. The system integrates computer vision techniques and embedded programming to achieve reliable performance.

## Components Used

- **Jetson Nano**: Main computing unit.
- **Camera Module**: For visual input to detect lines and obstacles.
- **ResNet-based Model**: For real-time decision-making.

---

## How It Works

1. The camera captures the visual field, identifying lines and obstacles.
2. The ResNet-based model processes the input to determine the robot's next action.
3. The motor control system adjusts the robot's movements based on model predictions.

## Results

The robot successfully follows lines while avoiding obstacles in various environmental conditions, demonstrating robustness and efficiency. The demo video demonstrates the robot completing an unknown track in the final project demonstration.
